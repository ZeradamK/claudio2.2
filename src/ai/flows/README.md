# Multi-Layer Processing for Jarvis AI

This directory contains the specialized multi-layer processing system for the Jarvis AI assistant. The system is designed to enhance the intelligence and responsiveness of the AI through a series of processing layers.

## Architecture Overview

The multi-layer approach consists of the following key components:

1. **Intent Detection Layer**: Sophisticated pattern matching and natural language understanding to determine the user's intent.
2. **Language Detection Layer**: Identifies programming languages and technical contexts.
3. **Context Generation Layer**: Creates appropriate context based on architecture, conversation history, and intent.
4. **Prompt Engineering Layer**: Constructs specialized prompts optimized for different intent types.
5. **AI Processing Layer**: Handles the interaction with large language models, including streaming responses.
6. **Post-Processing Layer**: Enhances and structures raw AI responses for better user experience.
7. **Follow-up Generator**: Creates contextually relevant follow-up suggestions.

## Key Files

- `multi-layer-processor.ts`: Core processing system with specialized handling for different intents
- `followup-generator.ts`: Generates relevant follow-up suggestions based on context and intent
- `jarvis-connector.ts`: Connects the multi-layer system to external API endpoints

## API Endpoints

The multi-layer system is exposed through multiple API endpoints:

- `/api/jarvis-assistant-stream`: Streaming version with real-time output
- `/api/jarvis-multi-modal`: Handles both text and image inputs (multi-modal)

## Specialized Processing by Intent

The system uses tailored processing for different intent types:

- **Architecture Updates**: Specialized parsing and validation of architecture changes
- **CDK Generation**: Enhanced code generation with AWS best practices
- **Architecture Explanation**: Structured explanations with clear sections
- **Architecture Rationale**: Comprehensive analysis with cost estimates
- **Code Generation/Explanation**: Language-specific handling with proper formatting

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { processJarvisRequestWithLayers } from '@/ai/flows/jarvis-connector';

// Process a request with the multi-layer system
const result = await processJarvisRequestWithLayers(
  userMessage,
  architectureContext,
  {
    enhancedPrompting: true,
    ragAugmentation: true
  }
);

// Use the enhanced response
console.log(result.response);
console.log(result.metadata.suggestedFollowUps);
```

## Benefits Over Standard Approach

The multi-layer approach provides several advantages:

1. **Intent-Optimized Prompts**: Each intent type gets specialized prompts for better results
2. **Enhanced Context Management**: Only relevant context is included based on intent
3. **Specialized Post-Processing**: Responses are formatted specifically for each intent type
4. **Contextual Follow-ups**: Suggestions are generated based on current context and intent
5. **Streaming Capability**: Real-time responses for better user experience

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the system include:

- Integration with knowledge bases and documentation (RAG)
- Multi-turn conversation memory with summarization
- Fine-tuned models for specific intent types
- Performance analytics and optimization
